Time, Location: Tue 13-14, Techno-Z, T03; Th 14-16, Techno-Z, T06.  First lecture on Oct 7, 2004.

<P>

Brief overview:

<P>

This course is an experiment. Within the first 3-4 weeks various concurrency
models and operating system concepts will be introduced. E.g., events,
threads, signals, semaphores, and sockets will be covered. Then, within the
remainder of the semester, all students will, in a team-based effort, develop,
implement, and run a simple web server but with state-of-the-art
performance. The students will form groups of 2-3 students where each group is
responsible for developing some part of the system. The students will choose,
buy, and administrate the required hardware (with funding from the <a
href="http://www.cs.uni-salzburg.at/~ck">Computational Systems Group</a>), install and maintain
appropriate operating systems and tools, and develop and implement the server
as well as the performance evaluation tools and scenarios. All sources and
presentations will be made available on the web.  The course hours after the
introductory 3-4 weeks will be used for discussions and code reviews.

Goal of the course:

<P>

Learn how to evaluate a highly concurrent application with high-performance
requirements, identify adequate concurrency model, programming paradigm and
platform, develop and implement the application and the necessary
computational systems infrastructure.

<P>

Assignments:

<ul>
<li>
Each student is expected to read papers (see list below) before certain
lectures (not more than one paper per week) and send a short summary (3-4
bullet items) of each paper by email before these lectures.
</li>

<li>
There will be a few home work assignments, e.g., programming exercises.
</li>

<li>
Teams of 2-3 students will develop and implement parts of the web server
project, present their parts at the end of the semester, and write project
reports that could eventually result in publications.
</li>
</ul>
