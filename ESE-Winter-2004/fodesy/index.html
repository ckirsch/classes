	<b>Intentions at the begining</b><br>
	We try to implement a fog detection system, consisiting of 
	interconnected telos motes. The Fog detection seems to fit perfectly
	for the different sensors (humidity,temperature and light) provided by the <a href="http://www.moteiv.com/" target="_blank">telos</a> motes.
	The motes are able to build up an ad hoc network to provide 
	highest flexibility and easy expansion.<br>
	The system should work as follows: one mote 
	detects fog in its area and transmits this informations to all motes in range. 
	The recieving motes evaluate the information, e.g. the hops the message took ( is the message
	from the mote which has detected the fog or has it been passed through by motes between the
	detecting and the recieving mote ) According to these informations the motes can act e.g. turn
	on warning lights or try to send the message to a control center.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<b>What we actually did</b><br>
	The actual implementation we finally did, does not differ too much from the
	idea you can read above. The ad hoc network will only work if a master node ( root node )
	sends out a resync or init message. The information is passed to a laptop which
	has a mote connected that works as a kind of a network bridge.

	<tr><td><h3>Engineering the project</h3></td></tr>
	<td>
	<b>Intentions at the begining</b><br>
	We want to implement the project using two different approaches:
	<ul>Using tinyos</ul>
	<ul>Direct without overhead</ul>
	To assure that the project comes to an positve end we first try to implement our <strong>Fog Detection System</strong>
	using tinyos, the simpler approach, because an abstraction layer is added on top of the
	MSP430f149 Microcontroller and the sensors. Furthermore TinyOS comes with a special programming language called <strong>nesc</strong>
	which is a derivat of <strong>C</strong> and allows rapid application development due its modularity. 
	<br>
	<br>
	If there is enough time left we will try to implent the project directly in C
	to avoid the overhead (see above) that comes with tinyos
	<br><br>
		</td></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<b>What we actually did</b><br>
	Implementing the whole system diretly with C did not work out. We realized very soon that it is impossible
	to write the needed drivers (e.g. radio) in the given time so we pretty soon switched to implement
	everything in <a href="http://nescc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">nesc</a> the language in which tinyos is done. We defined
	our own little multihop message system, which is not only able to detect the motes in the network but 
	also provides some, but not very accurate, information where the motes are located, if the motes 
	are distributed along a street. It would be very interesting to improve this network architecture 
	to be even more reliable and more accurate about the positions of the motes. <br>
	For demonstration purpose we used <a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank">Java</a> to implement an application for prove of
	concept and simulating a street environment. During our tests we not only verified that the multi hop message 
	protocol works with 3 hops ( meaning to motes are routing a message ) but that it is quite reliable ( the network connection 
	was never interupted ) which is much more the merit of the really well done telos motes than ours.
   <tr><td><h3>Design issues</h3></td></tr>
	<td><b>Intentions at the begining</b><br>
	It is a fact that the <strong>Fog Detection System</strong> not necessarily follows any real time constraints nevertheless we want to 
	incoperate some design principles heard in the lectures. As we explained above Tinyos already comes with strong abstraction, therefore
   only the implementation with c will take advance of e.g. an e-machine.</td></tr>
   <tr><td>
   <b>What we actually did</b><br>
   As mentioned above the Fog detection System is event driven and does not fulfil any real time constraints
   nor has it to. Therefore an implementation of the e-machine seemed quite senseless and would only
   cause more complexity and a little bit larger code. Moreover tinyos already comes with high 
   abstraction ( which includes scheduling ) and as we allready pointed out, we did not implement
   the pure c version.
