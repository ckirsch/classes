<p>&#160;</p>
<p><b><u>Idea</u></b></p>Develop and implement a&#160; Lego Mindstorm car, which 
is parking automatically into a free parking place
<p></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Grafik1.jpg" width="506" height="232"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>Implementation</b></u></p>
<p><u>Car:</u></p>
<p>The car is equipped with a light sensor and two motors. The first motor is 
for driving forward or backward the second motor is to direct the car. (it works 
like a real car)</p>
<p><u>Environment:</u></p>
<p>The environment consists of 2 white boxes which delimit the parking space. </p>
<p><u>Conditions</u></p>
<ul>
<li>The car shall reverse into the parking slot
</li><li>The car should never touch a box.</li></ul>

<p><u>Action:</u></p>
<p>The car will be disposed beside the first white box. Then the program will 
get started.<br>While the car is driving forward it will get data from the light 
sensor. When the brightness of the environment is changing, the program knows: 
this is the beginning of the parking slot.<br>When the brightness is changing 
next, the parking slot will end. From the speed the car drives and the time from 
the first to the second box, the program can compute if there is enough place 
for parking. (The speed of the car is predefined).<br>When the parking place is large enough, the parking sequence will be 
launched.<br><u>parking sequence:</u> The angle of turn as well as the time the car will drive back will depend on the length of 
the parking slot. By driving backwards 
the program will compute the angle the car reaches from the rounds of two 
motors. A predefined angle can not be passed over, as it can not drive the hole 
way with the same angle. The angel for driving back has to change after a 
specific way (in relation of the whole lenght&#160; of the parking slot). When 
the computed way for driving back is reached, the car will change the angle of 
turn and drive forward a computed time. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>The Program:</b></u></p>
<p>The control of the car is carried out by the developed EMachine. The program 
which controls the car consists of E- and S-code. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Task description </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="system-diagramm.jpg" width="863" height="268"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>acceleration task:</u> The acceleration task controls one motor which executes 
the forward or backward moving of the car. </p>
<p><u>steering task:</u> This task controls the second motor which moves the 
front wheels left or right.</p>
<p><u>calculate position task:</u> This task is invoked when the acceleration 
task is executed, and it computes the actual position of the car. The 
computation consists of the two tasks, acceleration and steering task. The 
position depends of the angel of the steering wheels and the time the car drives 
in a direction with this angel. The output is written in the <i>current position
</i>environment through the <i>write current position</i> port. The e-machine reads the 
current position out through the <i>read from environment</i> port.</p>
</br><p><b><u>Programming Language</u></b></p>
<p>Java</p>
<p><b><u>Operating system on RCX:</u></b></p>
<p>leJOS</p>
<p><u><b>Tecnical Implementation:</b></u></p>
<p>The E- and S-Machine, whereon the code will be executed, are running on a PC. 
This means all computations are executed on a PC.</br>The car will get the 
instructions via the infrared sensor.
A java program, 
<a href="http://rcxtools.sourceforge.net/" style="text-decoration: none">Rcxdirect</a>, 
runs on the 
RCX and receives and executes the 
instructions from the PC. The Advantage resulting from this method consists of, 
we have now much more resources for our programm, because we are not bounded to 
the limited capacity of the lejos and the RCX.</p>
