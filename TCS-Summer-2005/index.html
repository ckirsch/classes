<P>

Time, Location: Tue 3-4, Th 2-4, Techno-Z T04.  First two lectures on
Thursday, March 17, 2-4, Techno-Z T04 and Friday (!), March 18, 1-2,
Techno-Z T01 (to catch up with lost time).

<P>

Brief Overview:

<P>

This course is for the practically-minded graduate student who always
wanted to know what the theory of computation and systems is good for.
The course provides a hands-on yet graduate-level introduction to the
classical theory of computation and to the theory of computational
systems such as concurrent, reactive, real-time, and hybrid systems.
The first part of the course reviews classical automata theory, formal
languages, and computational complexity theory; the second part gives
an overview of concurrency models such as CSP, CCS, and Petri nets, as
well as of reactive, real-time, and hybrid systems such as timed and
hybrid automata.  The key question asked in this course is: why do we
need theories of computation and systems and how do they manifest in
practice?  The purpose of this course is to give practical meaning to
computer science theory and advocate principled engineering.  The
target audience are students interested in the design of complex
software systems such as operating systems, distributed systems, and
real-time systems.  Students will experience casual access to computer
science theory by designing (defining) and implementing (proving)
their own mini theories of computation or systems in class projects.

<P>

Goal of the course:

<P>

Learn how to make sense of computer science theory and appreciate
principled engineering.

<P>

Assignments:

<ul>
<li>
Teams of 2-3 students will define their own mini theory of computation
or systems, prove interesting properties, present their results at the
end of the semester, and write project reports that could eventually
result in publications.  Each team creates a wiki page
that describes the project.

Required Textbooks:

<ul>
<li>

Michael Sipser: Introduction to the Theory of Computation.  Boston,
MA: PWS Publishing Company, 1997.  Computer science theory presented
from a uniquely intuitive, "big picture" perspective.  I will mainly
use this book.

</li>

<li>

Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson: Computers and Intractability: A
Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness. New York: W. H. Freeman & Co.,
1979. The standard reference on NP-Complete problems - an important
category of problems whose solutions appear to require an
impractically long time to compute.

</li>

<li>

Hopcroft, John E., and Jeffrey D. Ullman: Introduction to Automata
Theory, Languages, and Computation. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley,
1979. One of the standard references in the field.

</li>
</ul>

Recommended Textbooks:

<ul>
<li>

James L. Hein: Theory of Computation. Sudbury, MA: Jones & Bartlett,
1996. A gentle introduction to the field, appropriate for second-year
undergraduate computer science students.

</li>

<li>

R. Gregory Taylor: Models of Computation. New York: Oxford University
Press, 1998. An unusually readable textbook, appropriate for
upper-level undergraduates or beginning graduate students.
