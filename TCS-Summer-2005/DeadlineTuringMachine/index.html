<p>Within the course <em>Theroy of Computational Systems</em> we had to define a mini theory of computation or systems with some interesting properties. These properties have to be proved and finally
written down in a project report.

<h2><strong>Abstract</strong> </h2>
<p>We report on a new computational model namely the <em>Deadline Turing Machine</em> DTM. The DTM uses a deadline within words of a given language can be recognized and decided. If a word cannot be decided within the deadline it is rejected by the DTM. This property implies that opposed to a Turing Machine it always halt. Moreover, a DTM can easily be mapped on a Turing Machine and is equal to it if and only if the deadline is infinite. Finally,
we also show that there exists a <em>Universal Deadline Turing Machine</em> which can be built of a TM with two tapes and two separate heads.
