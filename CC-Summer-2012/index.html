Brief Overview:

<P>

Learn hands-on how to construct a self-compiling compiler in a
non-trivial subset of C along with a DLX-based emulator as target and
a linker for separate compilation, using nothing but a C compiler for
bootstrapping.  The course provides an undergraduate-level
introduction to compiler construction, covering fundamental topics of
compiler construction: scanning, parsing, type checking, error
handling, register allocation, code generation, bootstrapping,
separate compilation, and basic code optimization; considering
fundamental programming language constructs and concepts: assignment,
arithmetic and boolean expressions, arrays, records, pointers,
conditionals, loops, modules, and procedures with parameters, return
values, and local variables.  At the end of the course you will be
able to appreciate principled engineering of compilers but also know
how to actually construct one from scratch and, as a consequence,
through insights in programming language semantics that only a
compiler can offer, become a fundamentally better programmer and
computer scientist.
<br><br>
Teams of 2-3 students will be asked to design their own source
language (with formal grammar), and implement their own compiler,
linker, and target machine in programming languages of their choice.
Each compiler must be able to compile itself in a live demo at the end
of the semester.  Therefore, source languages are constrained to
subsets of programming languages for which executable compilers are
available (unless students choose to apply manual bootstrapping
techniques).  Moreover, source languages must be typed (basic types,
arrays, and records) and feature at least a concept for parameterized
local hiding such as procedures with arguments and a concept for
global hiding such as modules supporting separate compilation.  There
will also be a final exam at the end of the semester.
<br><br>
The course closely follows the
textbook <a href="http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf">Compiler
Construction</a>
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus
Wirth</a> but presents code examples written in a subset of C rather
than Oberon.

Goal of the course:

<P>

Learn, through compiler construction, how software-related concepts of
programming languages such as data types and procedures work and
translate into hardware-related concepts such as machine registers and
code.

Assignments:

<ul>
<li>
There will be biweekly homework assignments.
</li>

<li>
Teams of 2-3 students will design their own source language (with
formal grammar), and implement their own compiler, linker, and target
machine in programming languages of their choice.  Each compiler will
be demonstrated to compile itself at the end of the semester.  Each
team creates a wiki page
that describes the project.  See the requirements in the above overview.

</ul>

Final exam:

<ul>
<li>

There will be a final exam at the end of the semester.
