Brief Overview:

<P>

This course provides an introduction to compiler construction:
scanning, parsing, semantic analysis, control-flow and data-flow
analysis, register allocation, code generation, and code optimization.
The course closely follows the textbook "Compiler Construction" by
Niklaus Wirth.  The goal of the course is to have students understand
and appreciate principled engineering of compilers through a focus on
fundamental rather than advanced compilation techniques in class in
combination with creative freedom in class projects.  Teams of 2-3
students will be asked to design their own source language (with
formal grammar), and implement their own compiler and target machine
in a programming language of their choice.  However, each compiler
must be able to compile itself in a live demo at the end of the
semester.  Therefore, source languages are constrained to subsets of
programming languages for which executable compilers are available
(unless students choose to compile their compiler at least once by
hand).  Moreover, source languages must be typed (basic types, arrays,
and records; no pointers) and feature at least a concept for
parameterized local hiding such as procedures with arguments and a
concept for global hiding such as modules supporting separate
compilation.

<P>

Goal of the course:

<P>

Learn, through compiler construction, how software-related concepts of
programming languages such as data types and procedures work and
translate into hardware-related concepts such as machine registers and
code.

Assignments:

<ul>
<li>

There will be occasional homework assignments.

</li>

<li>
Teams of 2-3 students will design their own source language (with
formal grammar), and implement their own compiler and target machine
in a programming language of their choice.  Each compiler will be
demonstrated to compile itself at the end of the semester.  Each
team creates a wiki page
that describes the project.  See the requirements in the above overview.
