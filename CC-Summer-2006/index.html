Time, Location: Tue 10-12 in T03, Techno-Z and Th 1-2
in T02, Techno-Z.  First lecture is on
Tue, March 7, 2006.

Brief Overview:

<P>

This course provides an introduction to compiler construction:
scanning, parsing, symbol-table handling, code generation, and code
optimization.  The course closely follows the <a
href="http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf">textbook</a>
on compiler construction by N. Wirth and, in addition, provides some
more details on bottom-up parsing and compiler generators.  The goal
of the course is to have students understand and appreciate principled
engineering of compilers through a focus on fundamental rather than
advanced compilation techniques in class in combination with creative
freedom in class projects.  Teams of 2-3 students will be asked to
design their own source language (with formal grammar), and implement
their own compiler and target machine in a programming language of
their choice.  However, each compiler must be able to compile itself
in a live demo at the end of the semester.  Therefore, source
languages are constrained to subsets of programming languages for
which executable compilers are available (unless students choose to
compile their compiler at least once by hand).  Moreover, source
languages must be typed (basic types, arrays, and records; no
pointers) and feature at least a concept for parameterized local
hiding such as procedures with arguments and a concept for global
hiding such as modules supporting separate compilation.

<P>

Goal of the course:

<P>

Learn, through compiler construction, how software-related concepts of
programming languages such as data types and procedures work and
translate into hardware-related concepts such as machine registers and
code.

Assignments:

<ul>
<li>

There will be occasional homework assignments.

</li>

<li>
Teams of 2-3 students will design their own source language (with
formal grammar), and implement their own compiler and target machine
in a programming language of their choice.  Each compiler will be
demonstrated to compile itself at the end of the semester.  Each
team creates a wiki page
that describes the project.  See the requirements in the above overview.
